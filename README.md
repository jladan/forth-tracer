# forth-tracer
A ray tracer written in Forth

[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) is a stack-based language from the 70s. I was inspired to write this program in 2012 after ssalbiz gave a tutorial in writing a raytracer at a CSC code party.

## Capabilities
It is a quite rudimentary ray tracer, handling
- spheres
- coloured point light sources
- diffuse and specular shading
- shadows
- ambient light

Looks like I threw in 4x4 anti-aliasing as well (according to the code).
